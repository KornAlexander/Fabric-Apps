"""Load the area-of-interest configuration.

PLAN §14 Q2: Gleitschirm-Insights is a reusable vertical asset. No coordinate, place name or site
id belongs in a source file — it all comes from config/aoi/<id>.json. Oberstdorf/Nebelhorn is the
first instance of this app, not the app itself.

The AOI has two tiers (PLAN §4.1), and every helper here takes the tier as an argument rather than
assuming one:

  core   the photoreal box — LDBV DGM1, buildings, trees, land cover
  shell  the coarse horizon — Copernicus DEM, terrain only, crosses into Austria
