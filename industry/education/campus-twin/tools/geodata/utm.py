"""WGS84 <-> UTM conversion for any northern-hemisphere zone, without a projection library.

Standard Transverse Mercator on the GRS80/WGS84 ellipsoid (Krüger series, 6th order), which is
what EPSG:258xx uses. Accurate to a few millimetres across a UTM zone — far beyond what a 1 m
terrain grid needs.

Implemented here rather than pulled in as a dependency: `pyproj` ships large binary wheels, and
this repo is destined for public packaging (PLAN §14 Q6), so the fewer heavy dependencies the
better. This is the only projection maths the project needs.

⚠️ **THE ZONE IS A PROPERTY OF THE AOI, NOT OF THIS MODULE.** Until TU Berlin the whole repo was
zone 32 (EPSG:25832) and this file hard-coded `UTM_ZONE = 32`. Berlin's survey data is EPSG:25833,
and the reason that matters is not mainly distortion — it is that **the source tiles are indexed by
zone-33 eastings**. The fetchers discover tiles by arithmetic on the coordinate (see `fetch_bvv.py`:
"tile discovery is arithmetic, not a catalogue"), so reading a Berlin easting as if it were zone 32
does not produce a slightly shifted tile, it produces a tile several hundred kilometres away or no
tile at all.

The distortion is the secondary argument and it is smaller than it first looks: measured across a
4 km baseline over TU Berlin, zone 32 is **+0.66 m per kilometre**, not the ~2.7 m/km a naive
"offset from the central meridian" estimate suggests, because the k0 = 0.9996 deficit cancels much
of the growth. It is still enough to spend a 5 km campus separation's whole ≤3.0 m budget in
`verify_registration.py`, but it is the tile indexing that makes zone 33 mandatory rather than
preferable.

⚠️ **A ZONE IS NOT DECIDED BY LONGITUDE.** `zone_for_lon` gives the nominal zone, and German
survey authorities do not follow it: Bavaria publishes the whole state in zone 32 although it
reaches 13.8°E, so OTH Regensburg (12.10°E) is correctly EPSG:25832 despite nominally falling in
zone 33. Any consistency check against the nominal zone must therefore be a tolerance question,
not an equality — see `_bind_utm_zone` in `aoi.py`.

⚠️ **THE `*_utm32` NAMES WERE DELETED RATHER THAN ALIASED TO ZONE 32.** Keeping them as
zone-32 shims was the obvious migration, and it is exactly wrong: any call site missed during the
migration would keep importing successfully and keep returning confidently wrong coordinates for
Berlin. Removing the names turns every missed call site into an ImportError at startup. Fail
loudly at import, never quietly by metres.

Only the central meridian depends on the zone. The ellipsoid and the meridional-arc coefficients
below are the same for every zone, so there is nothing per-zone to cache.
